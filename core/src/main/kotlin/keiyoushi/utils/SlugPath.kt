 * `<fixed prefix><slug><fixed suffix>`.
 *
 * Backward compatible: a stored value starting with "/" is assumed to be a full path saved by an
 * older version of the source (before it adopted slug storage) and is resolved unchanged, so
 * existing library entries keep working without a migration step. Likewise, a stored value that
 * is already a full "http(s)://" URL - left behind by even older code that tried to strip a
 * hardcoded baseUrl prefix off a scraped absolute href and silently failed whenever the href's
 * host didn't match exactly (a domain rebrand, a scheme mismatch, a mirror) - is also passed
 * through unchanged, otherwise it gets treated as a bare slug and the prefix is glued onto the
 * front of the full URL, e.g. "https://host/novel/https://host/novel/some-slug".
